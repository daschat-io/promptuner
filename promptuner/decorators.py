Modify the prompt to include the following instructions:

1. Before providing your final answer, use a <thinking></thinking> section as a scratchpad.
2. Within these tags, break down the task, consider different aspects, and explore your reasoning process.
3. Use this space to:
   - Analyze the given information
   - Consider multiple approaches or perspectives
   - Identify potential challenges or edge cases
   - Develop a structured approach to solving the task
4. After your thorough analysis in the <thinking> section, provide your final, refined answer wrapped in <result> tags.

Emphasize that the content within <thinking> tags should be a visible part of the response, allowing for transparency in the problem-solving process. The final, concise answer should then be presented within <result> tags.

Here's a general structure to suggest:

<thinking>
[Detailed analysis and thought process here]
</thinking>

<result>
[Final, refined answer based on the thinking process]
</result>

Encourage a balance between comprehensive thinking and concise final answers."""

1. Explicitly state its thought process.
2. Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.
3. Show its reasoning for each step.
4. Explain how each step leads to the next.
5. Summarize its conclusions based on this step-by-step analysis.

For example, instead of just asking for a final answer, the prompt should instruct the AI to think through the problem like this:

"Let's approach this step-by-step:
1. First, we need to understand...
2. Given this information, we can deduce...
3. The next logical step is to...
4. Considering all these factors, we can conclude..."

This approach helps in generating more accurate and transparent responses, especially for complex tasks. The final answer should still be wrapped in <result> tags, but the chain of thought leading to it should be visible."""

1. Thought: Analyze the current situation or problem.
2. Action: Decide on a specific action to take based on the analysis.
3. Observation: Describe the result or outcome of the action.
4. Repeat this cycle until the task is completed.

For complex tasks, generate a few example cycles of Thought-Action-Observation to demonstrate the process. Then, approach the main task using this ReAct method, clearly separating each step in the problem-solving process.
